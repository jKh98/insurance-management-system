# insurance-management-system
A simple database console application that implements an insurance management system. The system has certain policies such as travel policy, motor policy and medical policy.
Each policy is charactarized by a unique id, an effective date, an expiry date, the policy type, a premium value, valid or not and a unique autogenerated policy number which is a combination of (year-tye-id).

Specific policy types have extra attributes based on their nature. For example, travel policy has departure, destination and a boolean for family. Motor policy has vehicle price as an attribute. Medical 
policy has a list of related beneficiary with at least one associated beneficiary.
A beneficiary type is charactarized by name of the person, their relationship (self, spouse ...), their birth date and gender. A medical policy may have only one beneficiary as self.
